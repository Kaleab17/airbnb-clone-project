## 0) Project Initialization (Checklist)

- [ ] Create a **public** GitHub repo named **`airbnb-clone-project`**.
- [ ] Add this `README.md` with the sections below.
- [ ] Make your first commit and push to GitHub.

**Suggested local steps:**

```bash
# 1) after creating the GitHub repo (empty) in your browser:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/airbnb-clone-project.git
cd airbnb-clone-project

# 2) copy these starter files in, then:
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initialize project with planning README and gitignore"
git branch -M main

## 1) UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary Pages

| Page                   | Description                                                                 | Core UI Elements                                                     | Example URL              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Property Listing View  | Grid display of available properties with filters                           | Navbar, Filter bar, Grid of Property Cards, Pagination/Infinite Scroll | `/` or `/search`         |
| Listing Detailed View  | Complete property details with images, amenities, reviews, booking form     | Image gallery, Title, Ratings, Amenities, Map, Date picker, Booking form | `/listing/:id`           |
| Simple Checkout View   | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation                                | Order summary, Payment form, Validation, Confirmation screen         | `/checkout`              |

### Why User‑Friendly Design Matters
A clear, consistent booking experience reduces friction, improves conversion, and increases customer satisfaction. Use clear labels, visible affordances, helpful error states, and predictable navigation. Prioritize performance and accessibility from the start.

## 2) More UI/UX Design Planning — Figma Design Specs

> Open the design in Figma and inspect components to capture the exact styles.

### Color Styles
- **Primary:** `#FF5A5F`
- **Secondary:** `#008489`
- **Background:** `#FFFFFF`
- **Text:** `#222222`
- **Secondary Text:** `#717171`

### Typography
- **Primary Font:** Circular, **Medium (500)**, **16px**
- **Headings:** Circular, **Bold (700)**, **24–32px**
- **Secondary Text:** Circular, **Book (400)**, **14px**

> Note: Circular is proprietary. If needed for development, use a free alternative like **Inter**, **Nunito**, or **Montserrat** with similar weights and sizes.

### How to extract styles from Figma (step‑by‑step)
1. Open your Figma file → select a component/text layer.
2. Open **Inspect** panel (right sidebar).
3. Copy **Fill** (hex), **Typography** (family, weight, size, line height), and **Spacing**.
4. Save these values in this README (or a `/design/tokens.json` file).
5. Repeat for Buttons, Inputs, Cards, etc. to build a consistent design system.

## 4) UI Component Patterns

Design for reusability and consistency. Prefer composition (small, focused components).

### Navbar
- **Contains:** Logo, Search bar, User menu (Login/Avatar), Responsive menu toggle
- **Behavior:** Sticky on scroll (optional), collapses on mobile
- **Props (suggested):** `user`, `onLogin`, `onLogout`, `onSearch(query)`

### Property Card
- **Contains:** Image, title, location, price/night, rating, favorite button
- **Behavior:** Click → go to listing page; favorite toggles state
- **Props (suggested):** `id`, `image`, `title`, `location`, `price`, `rating`, `isFavorite`

### Footer
- **Contains:** Site links, Company info, Social links, Copyright
- **Behavior:** Responsive columns → stacked on mobile

---

## Best Practices

- **Code Organization:** Keep a clean, modular structure (e.g., `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/lib`).
- **Version Control:** Use feature branches (`feat/…`, `fix/…`), small PRs, and meaningful commits.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile‑first; test at common breakpoints (360, 768, 1024, 1280px).
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG guidelines (focus states, ARIA, color contrast ≥ 4.5:1).
- **Documentation:** Update README, architecture diagrams, and API docs as you build.
- **Testing:** Add unit (components), integration (flows), and E2E (Cypress/Playwright) tests.

---

## Manual Review Prep

- ✅ Submit **on time**
- ✅ Ensure all required files exist
- ✅ Keep README sections complete and accurate
- ✅ Generate your review link (per your platform’s instructions)
- ✅ Ask peers for reviews

---

## (Optional) Next Steps — Implementation Skeleton

When you’re ready to code the frontend:

```bash
# Using Vite + React
npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # start the dev server
```

**Suggested folders:**

```
frontend/
  src/
    components/
      Navbar.jsx
      PropertyCard.jsx
      Footer.jsx
    pages/
      ListingPage.jsx
      ListingDetailPage.jsx
      CheckoutPage.jsx
    routes.jsx
    styles/
    lib/
```

Add a simple router (React Router), placeholder pages, and start wiring components to match the Figma design.
